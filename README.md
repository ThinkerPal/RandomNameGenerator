# Random Name Generator

This is a random name generator that I made for use to select people to answer questions

## Usage

Before use, compilation is needed as we do not ship a binary with this repo. See [Compilation](#Compile)

To use, type `./randomNameGenerator`. You may then proceed to type in names, line separated of course. Names with more than one word are okay.
After that, type ! to end the input.

The program would then ask if you would like a name, and you can respond to it with either a `Y` for yes or `N` for no.

## Compilation <a name="Compile"></a>

If you have not compiled any C++ code before, please run `./setup.sh`. Root permissions are needed to install the compiler.

To compile the program, run `./compile.sh`. This would compile a executable binary called `randomNameGenerator`. 


Feel free to make any changes to this program!
